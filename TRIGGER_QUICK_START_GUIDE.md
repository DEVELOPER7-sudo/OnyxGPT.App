## What are Triggers?

Triggers are keywords that modify how the AI responds to your requests. They help you get more specific, targeted, and useful responses.

## New: 250+ Triggers in 9 Categories

The system now includes comprehensive triggers for:
1. Reasoning & Analysis
2. Research & Information
3. Planning & Organization
4. Communication & Style
5. Coding & Development
6. Creative & Writing
7. Data & Analytics
8. Business & Strategy
9. Education & Learning

## Quick Examples

### "I need help reasoning through this problem"
Uses the `reason` trigger to provide step-by-step logical thinking.
